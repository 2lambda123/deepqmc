These stochastic wave-function-based approaches provide a very direct treatment of quantum many-body effects and serve as benchmarks against which other techniques may be compared. They complement the less demanding density-functional approach by providing more accurate results and a deeper understanding of the physics of electronic correlation in real materials. The algorithms are intrinsically parallel, and currently available high-performance computers allow applications to systems containing a thousand or more electrons. With these tools one can study complicated problems such as the properties of surfaces and defects, while including electron correlation effects with high precision. The authors provide a pedagogical overview of the techniques and describe a selection of applications to ground and excited states of solids and clusters.},

  abstract = {State-of-the-art machine learning techniques promise to become a powerful tool in statistical mechanics via their capacity to distinguish different phases of matter in an automated way. Here we demonstrate that convolutional neural networks (CNN) can be optimized for quantum many-fermion systems such that they correctly identify and locate quantum phase transitions in such systems. Using auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations to sample the many-fermion system, we show that the Green's function (but not the auxiliary field) holds sufficient information to allow for the distinction of different fermionic phases via a CNN. We demonstrate that this QMC + machine learning approach works even for systems exhibiting a severe fermion sign problem where conventional approaches to extract information from the Green's function, e.g.\textasciitilde{}in the form of equal-time correlation functions, fail. We expect that this capacity of hierarchical machine learning techniques to circumvent the fermion sign problem will drive novel insights into some of the most fundamental problems in statistical physics.},

  abstract = {Machine learning, one of today's most rapidly growing interdisciplinary fields, promises an unprecedented perspective for solving intricate quantum many-body problems. Understanding the physical aspects of the representative artificial neural-network states is recently becoming highly desirable in the applications of machine learning techniques to quantum many-body physics. Here, we study the quantum entanglement properties of neural-network states, with a focus on the restricted-Boltzmann-machine (RBM) architecture. We prove that the entanglement of all short-range RBM states satisfies an area law for arbitrary dimensions and bipartition geometry. For long-range RBM states we show by using an exact construction that such states could exhibit volume-law entanglement, implying a notable capability of RBM in representing quantum states with massive entanglement. Strikingly, the neural-network representation for these states is remarkably efficient, in a sense that the number of nonzero parameters scales only linearly with the system size. We further examine generic RBM states with random weight parameters. We find that their averaged entanglement entropy obeys volume-law scaling and meantime strongly deviates from the Page-entropy of the completely random pure states. We show that their entanglement spectrum has no universal part associated with random matrix theory and bears a Poisson-type level statistics. We show, through a concrete example of the one-dimensional symmetry-protected topological cluster states, that the RBM representation may also be used as a tool to analytically compute the entanglement spectrum. Our results uncover the unparalleled power of artificial neural networks in representing quantum many-body states, which paves a novel way to bridge computer science based machine learning techniques to outstanding quantum condensed matter physics problems.},

We devise efficient algorithms to translate an RBM into the commonly used TNS. Conversely, we give sufficient and necessary conditions to determine whether a TNS can be transformed into an RBM of given architectures. Revealing these general and constructive connections can cross-fertilize both deep learning and quantum-many body physics. Notably, by exploiting the entanglement entropy bound of TNS, we can rigorously quantify the expressive power of RBM on complex datasets. Insights into TNS and its entanglement capacity can guide the design of more powerful deep learning architectures. On the other hand, RBM can represent quantum many-body states with fewer parameters compared to TNS, which may allow more efficient classical simulations.},

The leading error contribution agrees with the leading term of the difference between the TCC energy and the energy expression of extended coupled-cluster (ECC) theory. It is suggested to evaluate this routinely at the end of any TCC calculation as a check of the reliability of the latter. The error of the ECC energy expression with respect to an expectation value is of O(S 6). The error of traditional CCSD with respect to an expectation value is not affected by the inclusion of triple excitations in CCSDT. Approximations to CCSDT are also discussed.

  title = {Faster and Lower Scaling Orbital-Space {{Variational Monte Carlo}}},
  abstract = {In this work, we introduce three algorithmic improvements to reduce the cost and improve the scaling of orbital space variational Monte Carlo (VMC). First, we show that by appropriately screening the one- and two-electron integrals of the Hamiltonian one can improve the efficiency of the algorithm by several orders of magnitude. This improved efficiency comes with the added benefit that the resulting algorithm scales as the second power of the system size \$O(N\^2)\$, down from the fourth power \$O(N\^4)\$. Using numerical results, we demonstrate that the practical scaling obtained is in fact \$O(N\^\{1.5\})\$ for a chain of Hydrogen atoms, and \$O(N\^\{1.2\})\$ for the Hubbard model. Second, we introduce the use of the rejection-free continuous time Monte Carlo (CTMC) to sample the determinants. CTMC is usually prohibitively expensive because of the need to calculate a large number of intermediates. Here, we take advantage of the fact that these intermediates are already calculated during the evaluation of the local energy and consequently, just by storing them one can use the CTCM algorithm with virtually no overhead. Third, we show that by using the adaptive stochastic gradient descent algorithm called AMSGrad one can optimize the wavefunction energies robustly and efficiently. The combination of these three improvements allows us to calculate the ground state energy of a chain of 160 hydrogen atoms using a wavefunction containing \$\textbackslash{}sim 2\textbackslash{}times 10\^5\$ variational parameters with an accuracy of 1 \$mE\_h\$/particle at a cost of just 25 CPU hours, which when split over 2 nodes of 24 processors each amounts to only about half hour of wall time. This low cost coupled with embarrassing parallelizability of the VMC algorithm and great freedom in the forms of usable wavefunctions, represents a highly effective method for calculating the electronic structure of model and \textbackslash{}emph\{ab initio\} systems.},

  abstract = {We study numerically the geometric entanglement in the Laughlin wave function, which is of great importance in condensed matter physics. The Slater determinant having the largest overlap with the Laughlin wave function is constructed by an iterative algorithm. The logarithm of the overlap, which is a geometric quantity, is then taken as a geometric measure of entanglement. It is found that the geometric entanglement is a linear function of the number of electrons to a good extent. This is especially the case for the lowest Laughlin wave function, namely the one with filling factor of 1/3. Surprisingly, the linear behavior extends well down to the smallest possible value of the electron number, namely, N = 2. The constant term does not agree with the expected topological entropy. In view of previous works, our result indicates that the relation between geometric entanglement and topological entropy is very subtle.},

We also test the wavefunction based on fully antisymmetrized product of independent pair orbitals. Despite its seemingly large variational potential, we do not observe additional gains in correlation energy. We find that pfaffians lead to substantial improvements in fermion nodes when compared to Hartree-Fock wavefunctions and exhibit the minimal number of two nodal domains in agreement with recent results on fermion nodes topology. We analyze the nodal structure differences of Hartree-Fock, pfaffian, and essentially exact large-scale configuration interaction wavefunctions.

  abstract = {The fact that Monte Carlo estimates for the expectation value of the Hamiltonian have no standard deviation for exact eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian has been used to construct electronic wave functions accounting for the total correlation energy of two helium atoms separated by distances larger than SUB to within 5 X Ry. The biased selection Monte Carlo method used is an extension of information sampling, which enables the analytical elimination of all possible singularities in V\$ and also allows the use of the Hartree-Fock atomic wave function to select the points. The trial wave functions are an antisymmetric combination of Hylleraas-type atomic wave functions multiplying an exponential containing dipole-dipole and dipole-quadrupole terms in a form involving 18 parameters. The standard deviations in the energy values were estimated using 200 well-chosen sample points. Best wave functions were found by keeping the points fixed and varying the parameters in the wave functions until the minimum deviations were obtained. The resulting expectation values and standard deviations were then estimated using 6400 points (-3 min of Amdahl460 V time). The range of energy values from this step were in agreement with experiment to within their standard deviations of less than 5 X Ry. The wave functions for two separation distances were tested much more severely to make sure that the above results were not due to a failure to sample enough odd points. A 10-hr run was made in which the expectation values were evaluated at 6.6 and 9aB separation and also the difference between these values. The runs using 6400 points were found to be valid, and in addition it was discovered that the energy bounds given by these wave functions are in agreement with experiment to within standard deviations of -3 X Ry and that their difference (1.3 f 1.4) X loT5Ry differs from the experimental 3.2 by about 1.4 standard deviations.},

If the nodal surface of a many-electron wave function is available even in an approximate form, the fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo (FNDMC) approach from the family of quantum Monte Carlo methods can be successfully used for this purpose. The issue of description and classification of nodal surfaces of fermionic wave functions becomes central for understanding the basic properties of many-electron wave functions and for the control of accuracy and computational efficiency of FNDMC computations. In this work, we approach the problem of automatic classification of nodal pockets of many-electron wave functions. We formulate this problem as that of binary classification and apply a number of techniques from the machine learning literature. We apply these techniques on a range of atoms of light elements and demonstrate varying degrees of success. We observe that classifiers with relatively simple geometry perform poorly on the classification task; methods based on a random collection of tree-based classifiers appear to perform best. We conclude with thoughts on computational challenges and complexity associated with applying these techniques to heavier atoms.},

  abstract = {Artificial Neural Networks were recently shown to be an efficient representation of highly-entangled many-body quantum states. In practical applications, neural-network states inherit numerical schemes used in Variational Monte Carlo, most notably the use of Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) sampling to estimate quantum expectations. The local stochastic sampling in MCMC caps the potential advantages of neural networks in two ways: (i) Its intrinsic computational cost sets stringent practical limits on the width and depth of the networks, and therefore limits their expressive capacity; (ii) Its difficulty in generating precise and uncorrelated samples can result in estimations of observables that are very far from their true value. Inspired by the state-of-the-art generative models used in machine learning, we propose a specialized Neural Network architecture that supports efficient and exact sampling, completely circumventing the need for Markov Chain sampling. We demonstrate our approach for a two-dimensional interacting spin model, showcasing the ability to obtain accurate results on larger system sizes than those currently accessible to neural-network quantum states.},

This ``on-the-fly'' determination of statistical quantities allows dynamic termination of Monte Carlo calculations once a specified level of convergence is attained. This is highly desirable when the required precision might take days or months to compute, but cannot be accurately estimated prior to the calculation. Furthermore, DDDA allows for a parallel implementation which requires very low communication, O(log2 N), and can also evaluate the variance of a calculation efficiently ``on-the-fly.''

  abstract = {In recent years, machine learning (ML) methods have become increasingly popular in computational chemistry. After being trained on appropriate ab initio reference data, these methods allow to accurately predict the properties of chemical systems, circumventing the need for explicitly solving the electronic Schr{\"o}dinger equation. Because of their computational efficiency and scalability to large datasets, deep neural networks (DNNs) are a particularly promising ML algorithm for chemical applications. This work introduces PhysNet, a DNN architecture designed for predicting energies, forces and dipole moments of chemical systems. PhysNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the QM9, MD17 and ISO17 benchmarks. Further, two new datasets are generated in order to probe the performance of ML models for describing chemical reactions, long-range interactions, and condensed phase systems. It is shown that explicitly including electrostatics in energy predictions is crucial for a qualitatively correct description of the asymptotic regions of a potential energy surface (PES). PhysNet models trained on a systematically constructed set of small peptide fragments (at most eight heavy atoms) are able to generalize to considerably larger proteins like deca-alanine (Ala10): The optimized geometry of helical Ala10 predicted by PhysNet is virtually identical to ab initio results (RMSD = 0.21 {\AA}). By running unbiased molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Ala10 on the PhysNet-PES in gas phase, it is found that instead of a helical structure, Ala10 folds into a ``wreath-shaped'' configuration, which is more stable than the helical form by 0.46 kcal mol-1 according to the reference ab initio calculations.},

  abstract = {We describe a method for imposing the correct electron-nucleus (e-n) cusp in molecular orbitals expanded as a linear combination of (cuspless) Gaussian basis functions. Enforcing the e-n cusp in trial wave functions is an important asset in quantum Monte Carlo calculations as it significantly reduces the variance of the local energy during the Monte Carlo sampling. In the method presented here, the Gaussian basis set is augmented with a small number of Slater basis functions. Note that, unlike other e-n cusp correction schemes, the presence of the Slater function is not limited to the vicinity of the nuclei. Both the coefficients of these cuspless Gaussian and cusp-correcting Slater basis functions may be self-consistently optimized by diagonalization of an orbital-dependent effective Fock operator. Illustrative examples are reported for atoms (H, He and Ne) as well as for a small molecular system (BeH2). For the simple case of the He atom, we observe that, with respect to the cuspless version, the variance is reduced by one order of magnitude by applying our cusp-corrected scheme.},

  abstract = {Artificial neural networks have been successfully incorporated into variational Monte Carlo method (VMC) to study quantum many-body systems. However, there have been few systematic studies of exploring quantum many-body physics using deep neural networks (DNNs), despite of the tremendous success enjoyed by DNNs in many other areas in recent years. One main challenge of implementing DNN in VMC is the inefficiency of optimizing such networks with large number of parameters. We introduce an importance sampling gradient optimization (ISGO) algorithm, which significantly improves the computational speed of training DNN in VMC. We design an efficient convolutional DNN architecture to compute the ground state of a one-dimensional (1D) \$SU(N)\$ spin chain. Our numerical results of the ground-state energies with up to 16 layers of DNN show excellent agreement with the Bethe-Ansatz exact solution. Furthermore, we also calculate the loop correlation function using the wave function obtained. Our work demonstrates the feasibility and advantages of applying DNNs to numerical quantum many-body calculations.},

In addition to greatly improving size consistency (restoring it exactly in the case of a geminal power), real-space wave function stenciling is, unlike its Hilbert-space predecessors, immediately compatible with diffusion Monte Carlo, allowing it to be used in the pursuit of compact, strongly correlated trial functions with reliable nodal surfaces. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach in the context of a double bond dissociation by using it to extract a qualitatively correct nodal surface despite being paired with a restricted Slater determinant, that, due to ionic term errors, produces a ground state with a qualitatively incorrect nodal surface when used in the absence of the Jastrow.},

  abstract = {Given access to accurate solutions of the many-electron Schr\textbackslash{}"odinger equation, nearly all chemistry could be derived from first principles. Exact wavefunctions of interesting chemical systems are out of reach because they are NP-hard to compute in general, but approximations can be found using polynomially-scaling algorithms. The key challenge for many of these algorithms is the choice of wavefunction approximation, or Ansatz, which must trade off between efficiency and accuracy. Neural networks have shown impressive power as accurate practical function approximators and promise as a compact wavefunction Ansatz for spin systems, but problems in electronic structure require wavefunctions that obey Fermi-Dirac statistics. Here we introduce a novel deep learning architecture, the Fermionic Neural Network, as a powerful wavefunction Ansatz for many-electron systems. The Fermionic Neural Network is able to achieve accuracy beyond other variational Monte Carlo Ans\textbackslash{}"atze on a variety of atoms and small molecules. Using no data other than atomic positions and charges, we predict the dissociation curves of the nitrogen molecule and hydrogen chain, two challenging strongly-correlated systems, to significantly higher accuracy than the coupled cluster method, widely considered the gold standard for quantum chemistry. This demonstrates that deep neural networks can outperform existing ab-initio quantum chemistry methods, opening the possibility of accurate direct optimisation of wavefunctions for previously intractable molecules and solids.},

  title = {Building Symmetries into Feedforward Networks},
  abstract = {One of the central tools developed by M. Minsky and S. Papert (1988) was the group invariance theorem. This theorem is concerned with choosing perceptron weights to recognise a predicate that is invariant under a group of permutations of the input. The theorem states that the weights can be chosen to be constant for equivalence classes of predicates under the action of the group. This paper presents this result in a graph theoretic light and then extends consideration to multilayer perceptrons. It is shown that, by choosing a multilayer network in such a way that the action of the group on the input nodes can be extended to the whole network, the invariance of the output under the action of the group can be guaranteed. This greatly reduces the number of degrees of freedom in the training of such a network. An example of using this technique to train a network to recognise isomorphism classes of graphs is given. This compares favourably with previous experiments using standard back-propagation. The connections between the group of symmetries and the network structure are explored and the relation to the problem of graph isomorphism is discussed.},

  abstract = {We propose an efficient method for approximating natural gradient descent in neural networks which we call Kronecker-factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC). K-FAC is based on an efficiently invertible approximation of a neural network's Fisher information matrix which is neither diagonal nor low-rank, and in some cases is completely non-sparse. It is derived by approximating various large blocks of the Fisher (corresponding to entire layers) as being the Kronecker product of two much smaller matrices. While only several times more expensive to compute than the plain stochastic gradient, the updates produced by K-FAC make much more progress optimizing the objective, which results in an algorithm that can be much faster than stochastic gradient descent with momentum in practice. And unlike some previously proposed approximate natural-gradient/Newton methods which use high-quality non-diagonal curvature matrices (such as Hessian-free optimization), K-FAC works very well in highly stochastic optimization regimes. This is because the cost of storing and inverting K-FAC's approximation to the curvature matrix does not depend on the amount of data used to estimate it, which is a feature typically associated only with diagonal or low-rank approximations to the curvature matrix.},

          , 
            We present a comparison between a number of recently introduced low-memory wave function optimization methods for variational Monte Carlo in which we find that first and second derivative methods possess strongly complementary relative advantages. While we find that low-memory variants of the linear method are vastly more efficient at bringing wave functions with disparate types of nonlinear parameters to the vicinity of the energy minimum, accelerated descent approaches are then able to locate the precise minimum with less bias and lower statistical uncertainty. By constructing a simple hybrid approach that combines these methodologies, we show that all of these advantages can be had at once when simultaneously optimizing large determinant expansions, molecular orbital shapes, traditional Jastrow correlation factors, and more nonlinear many-electron Jastrow factors.},
